# Tic-Tac-Toe Game - by Oumaima and Sohaib - ESIEE Paris







## Introduction

Tic tac toe is a classic 2 player game, which includes playing with X and O marks. The two players take turns, marking the spaces in a grid (3x3, 4x4 or 5x5).
In order to win the game, the players have to place their marks in a way where they line up in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row.

The game was made with Python 3.5

## Starting the game

The program that contains the game is entitled : morpion.py. You have to download the ZIP file and unzip it and then run the program.
Once the code is run successfully you'll be asked to enter your name and so will the second player. Afterwards, you'll get to choose between the X and O marks or quit if you wish. Finally, you'll have three levels of difficulty to choose from: easy (3x3), medium (4x4) and hard (5x5).After each turn a scoreboard will have each players score displayed and updated according to the results of each turn. You can have as many turns as you wish until a player chooses to quit.

To have a good experience while playing, it's important that you fully open your terminal after you run the program !

## Made with

To create the program, we used VisualstudioCode, a code editor redefined and optimized for building applications.
